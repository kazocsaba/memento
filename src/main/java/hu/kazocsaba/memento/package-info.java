/**
 * The Memento library provides support for storing typed properties. It supports common data types including
 * integers, doubles, longs, strings, byte arrays, and allows hierarchical organization of data to express complex
 * structures. Thus it is stronger than simple string-string mappings like {@code Properties} and ini files, but not
 * so heavy-weight as databases.
